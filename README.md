ho ho ho unofficial cobalt rich presence mod

"how use??" you might be saying rn
I say put this in your build.gradle.kts file:
```idk
    repositories {
        maven("https://jitpack.io")
    }
    dependencies {
        implementation("com.github.evilpiza:cobalt-cdp:Whatever the latest tag is")
    }
```
or just use stable since it works :)
for silly goobers who don't know how to use this very easy library:
```yes
