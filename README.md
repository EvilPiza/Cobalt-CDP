ho ho ho unofficial cobalt rich presence mod

the cdp stands for 'custom discord presence' btw

"how use??" you might be saying rn.

I say put this in your build.gradle.kts file:
```idk
    repositories {
        maven("https://jitpack.io")
    }
    dependencies {
        implementation("com.github.evilpiza:cobalt-cdp:stable")
    }
```
the 'stable' ending after the colon is the lag, you can replace it with the most recent tag but stable gets the job done, so do what you wanna do ig

for silly goobers who don't know how to use this very easy library:
```yes
